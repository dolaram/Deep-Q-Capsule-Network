# Deep-Q-Capsule-Network
Capsule Network has been tested for Deep Q reinforcement leaning.

A Keras (branch [tf2.2](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras/tree/tf2.2) supports TensorFlow 2) implementation of CapsNet in the paper:   
[Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst, Geoffrey E Hinton. Dynamic Routing Between Capsules. NIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)   
The current `average test error = 0.34%` and `best test error = 0.30%`.
